CBDCs are inevitable not just for the USA but all countries vying to be the world’s next superpower

-The 5th Industrial Revolution, aka The Space Economy, is a digitally native ecosystem.

-To that end, the “money” and “currency” of the 5th Industrial Revolution itself must be digital for a simple reason of usability

-For this practical reason, as more and more critical government functions go digital and people become more dependent on digital infrastructure, features and conveniences, there must be a native digital currency that allows trade, commerce, finance; while empowering everyday life.

-This is why CBDCs are not only inevitable from a US perspective but also inevitable for any country who wishes to be a global power in the 22nd century and beyond: China, Russia, India, Nigeria, Brazil, Australia, etc.
