Let us look at some key numbers to understand India's digital and financial infrastructure before getting into the CBDC details.
1, The country launched Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in 2016. In the last 6 years, UPI has grown at 55% CAGR. 358 banks in the country use UPI and nearly 
$6.8 Billion in transactions have taken place on UPI rails (as of Sep 2022).
2, Printing and management of Rupee has cost the country around $600 Million (5000 crore INR) in 2021.
3,India is the world's largest beneficiary from remittances, with over $87 Billion flowing into the country in 2021.
4,Nearly 80% of adult males and 70% of adult females in the country own a mobile phone.
5,Mobile phone penetration combined with the last mile roll out of affordable mobile internet has driven digital inclusion. 850 million people in the country have
access to the internet.
6,Finally, nearly 35 Trillion INR ($430 Billion) is the estimated size of the shadow economy in the country. This is an estimate of black money held by Indians 
both overseas and inside the country.

There is still a long way to go for the country with nearly 600 million of them lacking digital access. Yet, the infrastructure needed to roll out a digital 
currency and motivations to do so are largely there. Now a 10 point TLDR from the CBDC concept note.

1, RBI are considering the launch of both a wholesale CBDC (CBDC-w) and a retail CBDC (CBDC-r).
2, CBDC-W could be used for improving the efficiency of interbank payments or securities settlement, as seen in Project Jasper (Canada) and Ubin (Singapore). 
CBDC-R is an electronic version of cash, primarily meant for retail consumption.
3,The paper describes a direct, indirect and a hybrid method of issuing and managing the CBDC. Direct mode is where the RBI is responsible for both issuance and 
distribution. Indirect mode is where RBI issues the CBDC and the banks take care of distribution. In the indirect mode (the preferred mode), RBI will perform 
checks and balances at the wholesale level, and ensure that is in-line with the checks and balances at the retail level too.
4, Distributed ledger technology (DLT) at this point of time, will be used in limited capacity. Parts of the CBDC system could have a centralised implementation 
where DLT struggles to cope with scale.
5, Another key design consideration is the anonymity of transactions. RBI seems to prefer a hybrid approach again, allowing anonymity for transactions upto a 
specific size. Large transactions must be transparent to enable anti-money laundering (AML) checks.
6, Nearly 600 million Indians will not be able to use CBDCs due to a lack of access to the internet. To ensure widespread use of CBDC, offline capabilities 
need to be incorporated. Several offline solutions are being considered to mitigate double spending risks. However, the paper doesn't provide a firm direction 
on an offline solution for CBDCs.
7, Indian CBDC will be able to leverage the current payments infrastructure like UPI, digital wallets like Paytm, Gpay etc.
8, Quantum proof cryptography will be considered while designing the CBDC.
9, Big data analytics on transactions will be used to identify money laundering and non-compliance patterns, and will inform proactive mitigation strategies.
10, Energy efficient infrastructure and consensus mechanisms will be used for the CBDC implementation. Where a token based system is adopted, unique tokens will need to
be created through consensus mechanisms. In such scenarios, consensus mechanisms used must be energy efficient.
The CBDC age is upon us and most large governments and central banks are rolling them soon, albeit with limited scope. The Indian regulators, government and fintech
authorities have demonstrated the ability to make large scale financial infrastructure roll outs on several occasions.
From the key design considerations listed above, it is clear that the RBI is taking a pragmatic approach to the CBDC launch. India's CBDC roll out could be another
case study, and a leap frog moment that could galvanise digital currencies for decades to come.
