 What are digital pounds? - by DeFi Talent Wiranya Chobchai

 Exciting news for those interested in the future of finance! The Bank of England and HM Treasury are exploring the possibility of a digital pound,
or central bank digital currency (#CBDC), which would be an electronic version of cash accessible through digital wallets.

 CBDCs, like the digital pound, are a new type of money that only exist digitally and are issued by a central bank. Unlike privately issued digital
currencies, such as Bitcoin, CBDCs are pegged to a country's national currency and are backed by the government. This makes them much more stable and secure.

A digital pound would work just like physical cash, with one digital pound being equal to one physical pound. It would be stored in smartphone wallets or on 
smart cards provided by private companies, such as commercial banks or technology companies. Users would not need bank accounts with the Bank of England and operators
of digital wallets would have access to the Bank of England's payments infrastructure.

The benefits of CBDCs are numerous, from increasing financial inclusion for the 1.7 billion adults worldwide without access to bank accounts to improving financial
stability and reducing financial crime. The Bank of England's primary objective in exploring a digital pound is to ensure payments remain denominated in sterling, 
ensuring monetary sovereignty.

The digital pound is just one example of the exciting changes happening in the world of finance. Stay tuned for more updates on this innovative technology!
