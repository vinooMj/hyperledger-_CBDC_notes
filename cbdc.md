Global economies are being swept up in the tide of change brought on by the crypto-triggered emergence of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

Intriguingly, CBDCs are not cryptocurrencies. CBDCs are created and managed by a nation's central bank or other monetary authority.

In the case of CBDC, a central database createss the currency and gives every e-dollar a unique serial number to identify it.

In addition, since CBDCs are a centralized form of money, this currency does not anonymize transactions like other cryptocurrencies.

Usually, central banks will also peg this electronic money to their current national currency.

A released White House statement suggested that Biden's administration is making progress in creating a CBDC to establish the dollar's preeminent position in 
international finance.

They claimed to have a reason!

The Secretary of the Treasury stated: "right now, certain features of our present payment system are too sluggish and costly."

Have they just recently become aware of this? Perhaps they're hiding something else.

Nonetheless, everyone is aware that this is a battle against crypto.

CBDC is now being adopted by 105 nations, which together account for more than 95% of the world GDP.



.CBDCs would give confidential information and vast power to a faceless government enterprise who can turn that information against you in countless ways. By eliminating the private banking middleman, central bank digital currencies eliminate a key buffer that helps insulate individuals and firms from government prying and overreach...

If CBDCs go live, solar and wind power, officially favored, could see their bank accounts magically subsidized with no need to attract private investors or to pass through the scrutiny of the private banking system. Bank accounts would become subject to the ballot box, or worse, the bureaucrat.

Anyone – especially political targets – could be unbanked overnight with little recourse.
