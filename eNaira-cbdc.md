Central Bank Digital Currency – eNaira

eNaira was inaugurated on Oct. 25, 2021, by President Muhammadu Buhari, making Nigeria the first African country to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency
(CBDC).

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Godwin Emefiele announced at the e-Naira hackathon on 18 August 2022 that, for the period between October 
2021 when eNaira was launched and now, the eNaira has reached 840,000 downloads, with about 270,000 active #wallets comprising over 252,000 consumer 
wallets and 17,000 merchant wallets. The volume and value of transactions on the platform have been remarkable, reaching above 200,000 and N4 billion,
respectively.

The eNaira is expected to enhance financial inclusion, support poverty reduction, enable direct welfare disbursement to citizens, support a resilient 
payments ecosystem, improve availability and usability of central bank money, facilitate diaspora #remittances, reduce the cost of processing cash, 
and reduce cost and improve efficiency of cross-border payment among others.

The CBN has unveiled a new short code for subscribers of its digital currency, eNaira to make financial transactions on the #platform. The aim is to 
enhance its acceptability with a focus on deepening payment system.

“I’m pleased and indeed delighted to inform you all today that by next week, Nigerians both banked and unbanked will be able to open an eNaira wallet 
and conduct transactions by simply dialing *997# from their mobile phones,” said CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele.

According to CBN Governor Godwin,
