Central Bank Digital Currency - E-krona

Sveriges Riksbank, Swedish central bank, has released a report of its central bank digital currency (e-krona) pilot phase 3.

Highlights 

üìç Governance Model: The starting point for the e-krona pilot has been for the Riksbank to collaborate with payment service providers to ensure that the general 
public has access to the e-krona if one is issued. In a possible future e-krona cooperation model, the #Riksbank can choose different levels of #governance, from a
low level
where participants have considerable freedom to design services and interfaces with the general public, to a high level where participants have to follow a predefined 
and uniform interface and range of services.

A low level of governance could promote competition & innovation but, at the same time, could result in the e-krona being implemented in different ways, making it 
difficult for the general public to recognise it. A high level of governance would ensure that there is a uniform supply & uniformly-designed services for the e-krona,
but could at the same time comprise an obstacle to competition and #innovation.

The conclusion is that the Riksbank, together with the actors in the payment market, needs to strike a good balance between the overall goals of an e-krona and the
needs of the general public and the market.

üìçPrivacy: The pilot raises a number of questions regarding #bankingsecrecy and the protection of personal data, for example. It is important that matters like this 
are investigated and managed carefully, not least to protect personal #privacy.

üìç #Programmability: The e-krona pilot has also examined the possibility of making conditional payments in e-krona and whether it is possible to use the technical 
platform on which the pilot is based. The #Riksbank carried out a successful test with a fictitious customer and car dealer. This involved a customer buying a specific 
car at an agreed price, but on the condition that the payment was only made when the customer was registered as the owner of the car.

The work has shown how the technical solution can make it possible to develop more advanced payment services for the benefit of users. However, conditional #payments 
can mean that more #data on the users is shared within the #ekrona network. It is important that issues like this are investigated thoroughly, not least to protect 
personal integrity.

üìç Project Ice Breaker (cross-border retail #CBDC) : The e-krona pilot has also participated in a cooperation project with the #BankofIsrael, #NorgesBank and the Bank 
for International Settlements (#BIS), which has examined whether #digital #centralbank #currencies could facilitate cross-border payment, which are often expensive and 
cumbersome.
