How does 𝐂𝐁𝐃𝐂 (Central Bank Digital Currencies) reduce 𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬-𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 payments to less than 10 seconds? 
.
The diagram below shows a cross-border payments prototype named ‘mBridge’ conducted among 4 countries. 
It renovates the whole architecture and reduces the transaction time to 2-10 seconds.

🔸 This is a joint effort among BIS (Bank for International Settlements – BIS) Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), 
Bank of Thailand, the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates.

🔸 Estimated transaction time is reduced from multiple days to near 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 (less than 10 seconds).[1]

🔸 The model gets rid of the 𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐤𝐬, which are usually used by domestic banks to interact with banks in other countries. 
This demonstrates mBridge can deliver real-time, cheaper, and safer cross-border payments and settlements. [1]

🔸 The technical architecture leverages 𝐛𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧 and 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐬 as the layer 1 infrastructure. In this way, the information flow and the fund flow 
can be executed at the same time, and the banking system can operate on the same infrastructure:

- The central banks can 𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐞𝐦 their CBDC.
- Commercial banks can perform 𝐩𝐞𝐞𝐫-𝐭𝐨-𝐩𝐞𝐞𝐫 payments.
- The transactions can be executed with the agreed FX rate.
