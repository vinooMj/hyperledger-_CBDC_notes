CBDC vs Stablecoins - is there really a difference?

Stablecoins are issued by private companies, not monetary authorities.

As popular as they are, stablecoins are issued by private companies such as Paxos and Tether. Although these may be subject to regular auditing and hold licenses, 
they are not government-owned organizations (who are responsible for fiat currency issuance).

This might not sit well with governments and central banks. Due to this, governments and their central banks have therefore begun experimenting with CBDCs.

Stablecoins are similar in the sense that they maintain stable prices and are pegged to a real asset. The only difference is that a CBDC is issued by governments and 
central banks.

In order to make this more clearer, we decided to illustrate how the stablecoin and CBDC landscape is now shaping up.
